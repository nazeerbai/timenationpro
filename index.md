Welcome to my website


If you're here on this website, most likely here soon you're going to buy a watch. Don't worry. We are here to guide you. I've got an excellent checklist that covers everything you need to think about so that you buy the perfect watch for you.  

## So first up, why do you want to own a watch nowadays?

**Less convenient to see time in the smartphone**  

Do you find it difficult to take your phone out and see time the time while driving or working. So you need to buy a watch to see the time as per your convenience and be more punctual.  
 
**Limited battery with the smartphone**  

Do your smartphones often switch off in the field due to battery drain, and you don't have a track of time? You might need to keep a watch over the time when you are in the field? Watches can operate for long in the field. Some of the watches are self-powered or uses a small amount of energy to be functional for a long time. These watches can be functional for years.
 
**Distractions caused by smartphone**  

Do you face this situation where you see the time in a smartphone but get carried away by checking out the notifications/apps on the smartphone. These distractions might hinder your work. You need to grab a good watch.
 
**Require More Functionality**  

Do your watch does not have the functionality that you need for your profession/field? For example, a swimmer needs his watch to be waterproof for a considerable depth inside the water.
 
**Lack of Respect/Style**  

Do you feel that you are not respected much by others? Options of jewelry for men are quite less. Try wearing a luxury watch. Wearing luxury watches makes people around you respect you more. It gives a sense of pride for those who wear it and helps you talk with confidence with other people. The watches you wear express your sense of style. For example, a person wearing a pilot watch is known for his aspiration/personality of being a pilot that can earn respect for you. Guys can add interest to their outfit by wearing a watch. 
 
**Appreciate Craftmanship**  

A wristwatch is considered more than being a time-keeper. They act as a symbol of art and tradition that is expressed in a showpiece by craftmanship. The dial can be a painting, or the design might be an act of pure artform. The movement can arouse fascination similar to what dial and case might express.
 
**Missing Your Loved Ones**  

Living through the memories of your loved ones is possible by wearing watches that belong to their era. Owning the watch of your loved ones makes you think of them even more.

    + Are you going to buy a smartwatch?

## Types of watches
Now let's talk about the type of watches based on
	+ Movement
	+ Style

Later on, we will talk about how to consider the individual parts of the watches while selecting a watch in later sections.

### Watch Type based on movement

Watch movement is a factor that must be considered before buying a watch. There are many types of watch movements out there. So the movement is going to be the inner mechanism that is going on inside of the watch, which moves the hand. It's the most critical factor, and understanding it is essential.
There are three types of watch movements.

+ Mechanical
+ Automatic
+ Quartz


#### Mechanical
The movement of a mechanical watch controlled by a mainspring — a curled wire of metal — that is twisted by hand. When the mainspring is wound, it gradually and equally loosens up, making the second hand move in a smooth, clearing movement around the watch's face. Most mainsprings are known to be around 9 to 13 inches in length. If the mainspring is longer, your mechanical watch's capacity to reserve power is more, and the more you can go between windings.
All the mechanical movements are not equivalent. The craftsmanship and attention to details that go into a watch will decide its smoothness and precision.
Some enthusiasts prefer mechanical movement watches because of their love of tradition and the intricate craft and designing that is into making them. For these lovers, owning a mechanical watch isn't just about reading a clock; it's an approach to express their thankfulness for history, refinement, and craftsmanship.

**Pros of Mechanical Watches**
**No battery required:** Since a mechanical watch is controlled by a mainspring that is hand wound, you'll never need to go to a watch specialist to replace a battery. At the point when the watch quits ticking, simply it means time to wind it.  

**Smooth hand movement:** or certain people, a harmonious clearing movement on the second hand is more stylishly satisfying than the "tick" of quartz watches. On the off chance that that is imperative to you, go with a mechanical watch.  

**Character:** The building and work that goes into a mechanical watch are amazing. Inside your watchcase are minute spring and gears that work together to show you the time. Of course, nobody, for the most part, observes it, yet that is a piece of the appeal; a watchmaker has put in a long period consummating work that is not visible. If you acknowledge craftsmanship, consider adding a mechanical watches to your collection.  

**Sense of touch:** For somewhere in the range of, one of the interests of a mechanical watch is that the proprietor must hand-wind it to keep it working. There's something about the custom of winding your watch toward the day's end that interfaces you more with time.

Cons of Mechanical Watches:
**Regular winding** While most mechanical watch movement can stop in two days without winding, it's prescribed that you wind it once every day. As referenced over, a few people get delighted from this. However, others find it a disturbance.
**Very Delicate:** Since a mechanical watch keeps time because of a gathering of complicated springs and apparatuses, its development can be very vulnerable to nature. Shock, Dust, Moisture, and magnets are the Four factors affecting the movement of the Mechanical Watches. Fortunately, most currently available watches are designed to withstand these negative factors. However, care should be taken. In case you're in living in places where you are highly vulnerable to such consideration, pick a quartz watch for everyday wear and can use the mechanical watch for dressier events.
Lacks Accuracy with age- While a well-created mechanical watch can keep time to 99.999% exactness (which is about +/ - 1 second), with age and utilize that precision begins to decrease. You need to visit watch specialist each 5 to 10 years for a check up to keep up its Accuracy. Likewise, not every mechanical watch are made equivalent; some are more precise than others. At long last, as referenced above, natural components can fall apart a mechanical watch's precision. On the off chance that carefully exact timekeeping is your top need, at that point you'll need to settle on a quartz watch.
Expensive - All that precision, craftsmanship, Accuracy, and engineering that goes into a mechanical watch is going to cost you additional. While there are some tremendous mechanical watches in the sub-$500 pricing range, most are more than that — frequently a considerable amount more.

#### Automatic
Automatic watches are similar to mechanical — a mainspring controls them and utilizes springs and gears to move the watch hands — yet they don't require anyone to hand-wind the watch to keep it working. Here in automatic watches, your hand movement while you wear the watch does the winding. So, the watches are called "Automatic" watches" or "self-winding" watches.
How does the self-wind happen inside the Automatic watches?
There's a little weight inside the watch called a "rotor" that moves as your hand moves while you are wearing the watch. The weight is connected to the mainspring and winds the spring as it moves. To prevent over-winding, Automatic watches do have a slipping clutch device.
In case you're not wearing your Automatic watch, you'll need to place it in a watch winder. It's a little gadget that moves the watch in a round movement while it's put away, so it remains wound. This is especially essential to do if your watch has highlights like a date-book or date show. For instance, suppose your Automatic watch has a timetable on it, yet you choose not to wear it for a couple of days. If you miss to store it in a winder, the power will rundown, and the presentation will stall out on time and date the watch stopped ticking. When you choose to wear the watch once more, you'll need to reset both.
Pros of Automatic Watches
No battery required - Try not to need to twist it by hand. If winding a mechanical watch pesters you, however despite everything you need the refinement of a mechanical watch, an Automatic watch is a pleasant trade-off.
Smooth development - Much the same as physically wound mechanical watches, Automatic watches have a pleasant, smooth hand development.
Character - A similar measure of designing and craftsmanship goes into an Automatic watch as a mechanical watch.
Cons of Automatic Watches
Very Delicate - The equivalent natural factors that can thwart a mechanical watch can gum up an Automatic watch.
Use Watch Winder: Should be put away in a watch winder when not being used. While an Automatic watch doesn't require winding on the off chance that you wear it routinely, on the off chance that you don't, you'll have to store it in a watch winder. Winders are generally economical, and they don't occupy an excess of rack room. However, it's one additional thing you need to purchase to claim an Automatic watch.
Less Precision- A well-made Automatic watch can b precise like a mechanical watch, yet it will lose some precision after some time and require check-ups.
Expensive - Same problems are similar to mechanical watches. Craftsmanship and building are not shabby!

#### Quartz
In case you're similar to most usual people, the watch on your wrist right presently is presumably a quartz watch. There's a purpose behind that. Quartz watches have unbelievably precision and budget friendly.
Unlike the watches as mentioned above, a quartz movement utilizes power from a tiny battery. The battery is used to send the electricity through a little quartz crystal, making the gem vibrate 32,768 times each second. The vibrations are estimated by a circuit, which turns the vibration into a pulse, which moves the second hand on the watch. Since quartz watches utilize electric pulse to move the second hand, they have a typical "tick, tick" movement. It will not be as smooth as a mechanical or Automatic watch.
Since quartz developments depend on electricity and have less moving parts, they're considerably more precise and can withstand definitely to a greater degree of impacts than mechanical or Automatic watches. It's hence that most "field" and "sports" watches are utilizing a quartz movement.
Quartz developments are likewise low priced.
Pros of Quartz Watches
High Precision - Quartz is by a wide margin the most precise of all the available movement. Will never lose or include seconds at any point of time for the whole duration of the day. Just for $4 you can get yourself a watch that keeps time like a champ. Obviously, in case you need something with more features, you'll have to spend more.
Less Maintainance - Other than changing the battery consistently, there's little maintenance you need to perform on a quartz development watch.
Long Life - Since they have few moving parts, a quartz watch can "take keep ticking and continue ticking." It's not vulnerable to the Four negative factors of the Watch Apocalypse. In case you're in an occupation that requires a great deal of harsh and messy work, you should need to consider a quartz development watch for regular wear.
Reasonable Pricing - You can get quartz looks for a couple of bucks. Even though more pleasant looking ones can cost into the many dollars, they're quite often less expensive than mechanical and Automatic assortments.
Cons of Quartz Watches:
No smooth movement - The movement of the second hand on a quartz watch is not as smooth as that of a Automatic or Mechanical watch.
Less sentimental - The most significant con of quartz watches is that they do not have the appeal, character, and sentiment of mechanical watches since they come up short on the history, specialized craftsmanship, and building such timepieces have.
So you have decided the type of watch.

### Watch Type based on style
But what about the style? There is a wide variety of styles out there.
    • Dress watches
    • Field watches
    • Dive watches
    • Flight pilot/Aviator watches
    • Driving/Racing watches
    • Sport watches
    • Smartwatches.
	• Pocket watch

#### Dress Watch
History/Pedigree/Personality: Birthed in the mid-twentieth century for wealthy men who wanted to wear their watch on their wrist, as opposed to in their pocket. The dress watch is about being simple and sophisticated; it's smooth instead of burdened. It will not appear flashy, and it attracts attention regarding itself in an elegant manner, and you can feel how it will compliment your get-up.
Marked Features:
Size: Usually meager (to make it simple to slip all through a dress shirt sleeve).
Case: The case may be rectangular, round, or square. Valuable metals like gold or silver are also used in high-end varieties.
Face: Dial shows simple hour indexes(symbols or numbers). For example, it might be Roman numerals, saber-style lists (little lines), or Arabic numerals.
Band: Usually leather material. Although a few watch companies offer both metal and leather choices with their dress watches, leather is the exemplary approach.
Complications: Little to none. Probably, moon display in addition to date.
When to Wear: As the name suggests, you wear a dress watch for dressier, increasingly formal events like with a matching suit or a tuxedo (however, there's discussion regarding whether you ought to ever wear a watch at all with dark tie). Be that as it may, you can likewise wear a dress watch with everything on down to sharp easygoing. It won't combine well with a shirt and pants.

#### Field Watch
History/Pedigree/Personality: The field watch is known to be the relative of the WWI "trench watch," which was intended for officers who expected to organize assaults, read a clock in the dark, and withstand the rigors of the fight, and also looking great. Field watches keep on displaying a military vibe and are rough, functional, and long lasting.
Mark Features:
Size: Small to medium. Huge watches would act as a burden while you're doing fight in the battle, or business.
Face: Functional, simple to-peruse numerical lists — regularly a white dial and dark numbering, or a dark dial with white numbering. The hands-on field observes frequently light up to empower time checks around evening time.
Case: Typically treated steel or once in while titanium (they should be robust, all things considered!). Field watches now and then incorporate a component called "hacking seconds" where you can stop the second hand by hauling the crown out; this makes it simpler to set the watch to a reference signal or synchronize it with another.
Band: Leather or canvas band. Metal is rare and would scratch with the sort of harsh environment where the field watch is intended.
Complications: Typically none, Usually the date is present.
When to Wear: Field watches are very super flexible and can be worn on a wide range of experiences just as for ordinary wear or even business wear. So, it can include everything from pants and a shirt to a games coat and khakis. For men, particularly more youthful folks, who don't use suit all the time, a field watch is the most logical option one can go for; its easygoing, simple but rough style may be the best match to your way of life.

#### Dive Watch
History/Pedigree/Personality: After the field watch, a dive watch is presumably another unique watch amongst the most widely used watch types you see with men.
Well, we need to thank Mr. James Bond for that. The well known 007 has been suiting a dive watch or something similar. In the early Bond films, it was a Rolex Submariner (which is the reason the jump watch are now and again called a "submariner"); at that point, Pierce Brosnan went for the Omega dive watch into Bond's timepiece of decision.
As the name proposes, the dive watch was intended for people who spend a lot of time in and around water. Their essential USP is that these watches are water safe & resistant. The first introduction of what turned into the dive watch was the Rolex Oyster, which was presented during the 1930s. It had a case that was hermetically sealed; it was one among the water resistant watches available at that time.
During the 1950s, Rolex load up part René-Paul Jeanneret needed a watch that would be valuable for when he went jumping (an interest he effectively sought after) yet at the same time looked great as an ordinary timepiece. The Rolex Submariner was conceived, and the standard for dive observes wherever was set. Most jump watches available today take their plan signs from the Submariner.
Mark Features: A dive watch is the most water-resistant among all the watches. Dive watches are known to be water resistant up to at any rate 100m. However, some continue working at even deeper depths.
Since it's can be worn in the water, both the band and the case of dive watches are produced using least corrosive metals like titanium or steel. (You can also see some jump watches produced using silicone or elastic material, as well. But, they won't look as classic as the metal ones.)
Size: Medium.
Face: Typically easy-to-read and bold, Arabic numbering is used or sometimes replaced by hash marks. Hardened mineral glass or sapphire is used to protect the face in submerged water.
Case: A characterizing highlight of the jump watch is the unidirectional bezel — which will only turn in a counter-clockwise direction. The bezel enables a jumper to know how long he remained submerged.
Here's how it works: when the jumper intends to enters the water, he turns the bezel so that the zero marking on the bezel lines up with the minute hand. From that point, the minute hand can be used to shows the time he remained in the water.
Band: Usually Metal. They usually are longer than other watches' bands, as it needs to fit around bulky diving equipment.
Complications: Usually, the date is found.
When to Wear: Even though the dive watch was meant for submerged use, it can be used for varieties of ordinary wear. You can wear it with your business wear or casual wear, and formal wear too. Also, if you intend to take style tips from James Bond, you can even wear a dive watch with a tuxedo.

#### Aviator/Pilot Watch
History/Pedigree/Personality: Wristwatches is a compulsory gear for flight since the beginning of flying. The first men's watch made explicit for the pilot was Loius Cartier in the year 1904.
After a few decades, watchmakers wanted to simplify the method of timekeeping for the pilots by including chronographs in their design. Chronographs were historically installed in planes and were used for deciding the speed, calculate fuel utilization, etc. The first chronograph watch was made by Breitling - A Swiss company in the year 1940.
Marked Features: The pilot watch does not have a particular, firm style, unlike other category men's watch. The highlights will vary extensively. We will see the kind of highlights that an average pilot watch would have:
Size: Medium to huge.
Face: Designed for simple perusing, even in a dim cockpit, pilot watches sport a larger than usual dial with perfect, neat numbers and radiant hands. To make perusing the time significantly simpler, the dial is typically dark with white numbering.
Face: The Dial is usually larger, dark, and will have white numbering. The hands are generally radiant, that makes it easier to view in the light-less environment.
Band: Often, however, not always, made of calfskin. Longer than usual, as the band was initially intended to fit around the sleeve of a pilot's flight coat.
Band: Usually longer, as it needs to fit around the pilot's flight coat sleeves. Mostly the material used to make the band is calfskin.
Complications: Date and may be accompanied by a chronograph.
When to Wear: Can go well with casual attire. But, it is not suitable for dark ties and formal business wear.
Driving/Racing Watch
History/Pedigree/Personality:
Wristwatch and car racing were connected since the 1930s. The reason being the quantification of time is required to calculate the race result. Rolex was one of the pioneers to work on racing watches that were used by top drivers with a watch model known as Oyster watch, dating back to 1930.
Initially, car races were wearing pilot watches of TAG Heuer. Later, TAG Heuer made a standard for racing watches by having more advanced features like tachometer & chronograph. Both these features are known to be the highlights of a driving watch.
Mark Features:
Size: Medium to large.
Face: Larger dial (to account for the chronograph), with clear Arabic numerals. Regularly incorporates brilliant, differentiating hues.
Comprises of a large dial(to accommodate chronographs) along with Roman numerals. Usually, they have contrasting & bright colors.
Case: Designed to withstand the rigors of auto hustling, the case is typically produced using hardened steel.
Band: Usually Leather or metal.
Complications: Chronograph and some of the time the date.
When to Wear: Racing watches will, in general, be flashier looking than dive or pilot watches. Due to their intense look, they're more reasonable for casual wear than formal wear.

## Special features you are going to look for

What specific features do you demand of your watch?
    • How much water resistance do the pressure release valve?
    • Do you need an alarm?
    • Do you need time zones throughout the world?
    • Do you need temperature?

#### Complications

An essential watch tells you the time.
Many wristwatches in the market come with little special features like displaying the date or the moon phase. These features are known as "complications."

How many complications you need in your watch may vary according to your preference. Formal wear watches are usually sleek and have no complications or just one(date). Casual watches tend to have more complications.

Some of the other complications are
    • Repeaters - On pressing the repeater button, it rings while the watch strikes the hours and minutes
    • Power reserve indicators - indicates the power
    • Alarms - used to set alarms
	•  Temperature indicator - used to measure the temperature around you
    • Chronographs - which acts a stopwatch
    • Tachymeter - used to measure speed based on time traveled over a fixed distance

Chronograph and tachymeter needs a little more explanation.

A chronograph usually consists of 3 small dials(also known as sub-registers) present on the main dial.
There are two buttons present on the side of the watch case -
Top button - is used to start/stop the chronograph
Bottom button - acts as a reset button

Some watches have a tachymeter paired with the chronograph. You can find the tachymeter inscribed around the watch rim. Both chronograph and tachymeters are used to calculate all various things like distance, speed, or consumption of fuel while driving or flying.

These are all things that once you put down what you need you're going to find several watches that you have to choose.
But by doing that you've narrowed down the selection and becomes easier to find and identify your dream watch.

## Options while choosing your budget

### Old vs. New watch
If you have decided to go for a new watch: You are bound to have no problem.
A new watch comes with a warranty.
You want to impress the people around you with your new watch story. This is the main reason many people spend on expensive watches.
Sometimes one may prefer to go for a luxury watch, but due to money constraints can opt in for a used watch which may be a few years old. You can get a good deal in the used market.
Some of the problems that you might face with the used watch are that it may have some mechanical issues. Probably, a missing part that might be visible while buying it. If you are quite good at knowing about watches, you can settle in for a used watch and can find a fantastic deal while you buy them.

### Budget
So now let's talk about money money money.
What is your budget you've got to have a budget? Yes, and everyone has a budget.
Here is a simple chart that might give you a brief idea of what you watch you might for your budget.
Price     Range & Material     Manufacturer
100 to 1000     Wide ranges     Mid-range
1000 to 10000     Made with precious metal     High reputation
10000     Precious stones & Limited gold edition & high reputation

### Personal Use Vs. investment
If you have decided to buy a watch for your personal use, then you can opt in to play with emotions a lot. It can cost a few more bucks and be least bothered about the resale value.
In case, if you are interested in watch flipping and making money: You need to be a lot more careful and make sure you know what you are going to do. Many people end up losing their money, and only a few make good money out of it.

## Checklist while buying
Now we have a check list to consider while you are in the verge of buying a watch…Lets have a closer look at the individual parts.

### Picking the Right sized Watch For Your Hand Size
You also need to consider how proportional the watch is to your hand and wrist.
If it appears bigger for your wrist, it might look awkward and larger. If it is small, it may appear as if you are wearing a women's watch.
Simple calculation
Measure the perimeter of your wrist and compare it as per the below chart
Wrist perimeter     Case size
6 to 7 inches     38-42 mm wide
More than 7 inches     44-46mm wide
The best approach is to wear the watch and test the look. Ask your family and friends to pour out their suggestions.
If you still feel that you need to go with the bigger ones - proceed. You are bound to flaunt and proclaim the world what is essential for you.


### Watch Glass
Now let's talk about the watches glass.
You're going to see mineral glass which is OK
you're going to see excellent sapphire crystal.
And then on the best, you're going to see some antique reflective coating. That's important because what you don't want is look at the time all of a sudden the sun's bouncing right off there You want to see the time when you look at your watch.

### Weight
Now let's talk about weight, and there isn't a right answer here because on a functional performance watch like this I want something lightweight I'm going to take this on a 50-mile hike I want. I don't want something too heavy but on a watch that is made from a precious material such as gold such as platinum. I wanted to weigh more than a metal watch that is a sign of quality.

### Illumination  

Next up, let's talk about illumination. If you need to be able to read the time at night you want to make sure that your light works appropriately and it lights up, and you can read, and not all watches are going to have lights, but a lot of them are going to have illuminated, and you want to look at OK. Is it raised and again turn off the lights look at it in the dark after you've exposed it some light and look at how it reacts?

### Clasp

Clasps can be majorly classified as
+ Deployant clasps
+ Pin buckles

Deployant clasps are usually seen on metal watches, while pin buckles are more frequently seen on leather and rubber watches.

Deployant clasps are considered to be more safer. Even if the clasp opens while wearing the watch, it will not fall off your wrist. But, when a pin buckle opens up, the watch is going to hit the ground and probably get damaged.

But all of them have something in common – they are considered safer, because even if they open up while you’re wearing your watch, it won’t fall off your wrist. Which can’t be said for regular buckles; if a tang buckle comes undone, your watch is going to hit the ground faster than you can say “tang”.

### Watch Case
Now let's talk about the case the watch of the case the watch is going to be the home of the movement, and you want to make sure that that case looks clean. You want to look at actually the finishing on that case. I can tell you a case that has been finished very well, that is an excellent sign of good quality.

### Watch-Material
Now let's talk about materials watches come in a wide variety of materials you're going to see and made from steel with a bit of leather and different qualities of leather.
You're going to see them with higher quality steel all of a sudden you're going to start to see with white gold you're going to see them with a mix of steel with gold, and even specific goals that are specific to the actual brand are gems.

### Brands vs. Non-Brand
Brands convey a brand story. Any watch collector will tell you about their most favorite watch, along with the brand story. Some of the brands have excellent quality control, while some others have an average level. This might be a deciding factor for collectors while making money during re-sell.

### Official Seals
Let's talk about official seals. So the main one you're going to see out there is the seal of Geneva. So this is a certification of quality in origin.
Now, this seal is applied to the movements of specific watches, and it's a big deal. There's Swiss law that ensures that it's stringent and they've got to follow all of these exact rules and stuff.  
Now just because a high-end watch doesn't have the seal, Geneva does not mean it's terrible, but it is something that if you've got it. That's a good thing.

### Where do you live
Next, up Where do you live? Do you have access to high-end watches that you can try on? You can see what they look like on your wrist. If you live in New York, Chicago or over in Switzerland. It is good for you. You can walk into a lot of stores, and you can see what those watches look like on your wrist. And that's important, especially when you're spending a lot of money.
So what do you do if you live in a small town? I know I've got this problem. So what I do is when I'm traveling I always make it a point to stop in and check out the stores in that city, so I'm Chicago. I have a store I go check out when I'm in London. I number of high stores to go check out. So you want to play a little bit of your travel. You want to find a way to get into those stores to try on the watches.

#### Retail Vs. Online
Next up, let's talk about how you're going to buy. So if you're going to buy directly from an authorized dealer or the manufacturer then that's great you're going to pay a higher price. But what you're going to get is satisfaction knowing you've got a warranty directly with them.
Now there is the online market or gray markets. It is going to be Amazon or eBay or any other e-commerce site  who is not the manufacturer or an authorized dealer? The key thing here to understand is if you buy your watch from an authorized dealer, you can go directly to the manufacturer for your warranty. If you buy it through Amazon, you've got to go through Amazon for your warranty.
